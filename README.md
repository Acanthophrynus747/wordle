# wordle
A Wordle imitation so I can play as many times as I want for free.

The color scheme is a little different in my version. Guessed letters that are not anywhere in the word appear in red. Like in the NYT version, letters in the correct place are green and letters that are present but not in the right place are in yellow. 

The game is a lot more awkward to play without being able to visually see the keyboard of letters that are present and not present, so I may look into adding a visualization of that at some point.
