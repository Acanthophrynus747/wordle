# wordle
A Wordle imitation so I can play as many times as I want for free.

The color scheme is a little different in my version. Guessed letters that are not anywhere in the word appear in red. Like in the NYT version, letters in the correct place are green and letters that are present but not in the right place are in yellow. 

The game is a lot more awkward to play without being able to properly see the keyboard of letters that are present in the word, not present, or in an unknown location. I have added a rudimentary keyboard display that highlights in red the letters that are present nowhere in the mystery word. It doesn't show letters with unknown position properly, but it works for letters that aren't anywhere (I think).
